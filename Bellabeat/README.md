# Bellabeat Case Study

This repository contains the Bellbeat Case Study that I had completed as part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certification. All data files can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) although only the following files were used in the analysis:
- dailyActivity_merged.csv
- hourlyCalories_merged.csv
- hourlyIntensities_merged.csv
- hourlySteps_merged.csv
- sleepDay_merged.csv
- minuteMETsNarrow_merged.csv

All data files used can be found in this repository with the exception of minuteMETsNarrow_merged.csv which was too large to upload on GitHub. You can however find the file in the link given above. In addition, I have also uploaded a copy of FitBit's data dictionery in this repository. This data dictionery is useful in explaining how some variables are collected and/or calculated. You can however also find it [here.](https://www.fitabase.com/media/1546/fitabasedatadictionary.pdf) The information was provided by Fitabase who collects all physical actvity data tracked by Fitbit devices

On most occasions, you will find others performing analysis on this dataset using R or Python. I have however chosen to complete my analysis using Tableau Public. I have split my findings into a 2-part dashboard. You can find them in the links below (note: they are best viewed on a big screen):
- [Fitbit Findings Part 1](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/karen.lee4168/viz/FitBitTrackerFindingsPart1/FitBitPart1) 
- [Fitbit Findings Part 2](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/karen.lee4168/viz/FitBitTrackerFindingsPart2/FitBitPart2)
