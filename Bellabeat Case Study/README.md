# Bellabeat Case Study

This repository contains the Bellbeat Case Study that I had completed as part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certification. All data files can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) although only the following files were used in the analysis:
- dailyActivity_merged.csv
- hourlyCalories_merged.csv
- hourlyIntensities_merged.csv
- hourlySteps_merged.csv
- sleepDay_merged.csv
- minuteMETsNarrow_merged.csv

I have also uploaded a copy of FitBit's data dictionery in this repository. This data dictionery is useful in explaining how some variables are collected and/or calculated. You can however also find it [here.](https://www.fitabase.com/media/1546/fitabasedatadictionary.pdf) The information was provided by Fitabase who collects all physical actvity data tracked by Fitbit devices

On most occasions, you will find others performing analysis on this dataset using R or Python. I have however chosen to complete my analysis using Tableau Public. 

## The Client - Bellabeat

[Bellabeat](https://bellabeat.com/) is a high tech manufacturer of health focused products for women. They sell a number of products but their key products are health trackers. The Bellabeat app connects to their line of wellness products and provide their users with health data related to their activities, sleep, stress, menstrual cycle and mindfulness habits. 

Other products they have include Coach, a subscription based membership programme for users which promises fully personalised guidance on topics like nutrition, activity, sleep, health, beauty and mindfulness.

## The Brief

The client has ambitions to become a larger player in the global fitness smart device market and they believe that analysing consumer data would reveal more growth opportunities for them. They have therefore requested for this specific dataset from Fitbit to be analysed so that insights can be gained on how consumers are using non Bellabeat devices. The brief also request for recommendations on how the findings can inform their marketing strategy.

## The Findings

Analysis was completed using Tableau public. I have split my findings into a 2-part dashboard. You can find them in the links below (note: they are best viewed on a big screen):

## Recommendations to Bellabeat

1. **Design of device**
 
The key metric for a company like Bellabeat would be user engagement with their products. They would want users to wear them every day 24/7 because it is the only way to get more data about their users' activities and lifestyles. Bellabeat already has a product that is lightweight (Leaf) and to create greater awareness for this product, a targeted marketing campaign can be carried to further promote awareness of this product.

2. **Campaigns to encourage desired behaviour**

Design of the devices aside, users need to feel they have a reason for wearing the trackers in the first place. So companies like Bellabeat could encourage desired behaviours through their marketing campaigns. If the majority of the users are not walking the minimum recommended steps, have a campaign encouraging an increase in step count, as an example. 

3. **Campaigns that encourage brand attachment**

Findings from the analysis reveals that users likely to burn the most daily calories are those who wear the device most frequently. This is not surprising especially if users have associated wearing the device to doing more activity or steps. There is a tendency for people to continue a behaviour if they have previously experienced positive results from that behaviour. So if Bellabeat has a campaign encouraging users to increase their step count, then follow up with a social media campaign targeted at those who indeed had increased their step count
